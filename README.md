# Computer-Security-Project-Reports
These are the projects completed in my computer security class that did not entail writing my own code. See pdfs for more detailed descriptions.

* SMIME and PGP -- used SMIME and PGP to get experience sending secure emails
* TLS -- Report demonstrating my understanding of TLS protocols and their specific use across multiple websites
* Password Cracking -- used Jack the Ripper software to crack a password using comparisons on a shorter than usual SHA1 hash
* Extracting Secrets -- used gdb to examine assembly code, alter registers, and gain access to text that would typically require a password. Had to use an object dump to find an address, flip a bit, and convert it back to assembly code to crack it.
* Buffer Overflow -- performed a buffer overflow attack

I've also added some homeworks that demonstrate addtional computer security knowledge

* Cipher Homework -- Describes numerous cipher techniques and how they would each behave in a number of situations
* Diffie Hellman and MM attack -- Describes in more detail the Diffie Hellman encryption protocol and a Man in the Middle attack
* MAC Methods -- Describes the different methods for producing a MAC for message authentication and which is generally the best
* Passwords -- My summary of an article talking about the flaws of password requirements
* TLS Description -- Describes the TLS protocol with all its steps
